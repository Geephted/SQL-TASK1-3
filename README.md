# SQL-TASK 1-3
## Introduction

This repository contains three diffrent tasks using SQL, I undertook three tasks that involved working with relational databases. These tasks required me to make modifications to tables, including creating, altering, and dropping tables etc. I also applied constraints to specific tables. Throughout these tasks, I utilized a range of SQL syntax elements such as SELECT, CREATE, DROP, ORDER BY, HAVING, and WHERE, among others.

###Data Set
The dataset consists of a single data file in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. Each row represents a unique medical student, and the columns contain different attributes of the students.
